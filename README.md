MAPS boot partition's files (zynq-7000)

## Introduction
a linux system consist of two partitions one is /boot and the second is fs(filesystem):

* <p>/boot partition files for our borad (xilinx zynq700) are generated from tool called petalinux which takes a hardware design file (.xsa) and a fsbl file and output BOOT.BIN, image.ub and system.dtb. </br>
these files are to put in the * /boot partition on a linux system.</p>

* <p>/fs partition is the filesystem partiotion 
filesystem can be download according to the distro(ubuntu, debian etc') and versions (7, 10.11, 18.4 etc) needed.</p>
